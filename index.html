<h5>"I keep myself busy with the things I do, but every time I pause, I still think of you"</h5>
<p>Poets use countless words to describe their pain, but I only need three: I miss you.</p>

<h5>
  Whenever I am not talking to you, I am passionately thinking of you! Missing you to bits!</h5>

<h5>I miss you like the sky misses the moon like the soil misses the raindrops like the flower misses the sunlight!</h5>

<h5>Hey dear, can you listen to my heart beating erratically for you? It is because I miss you!</h5>

<h5>I miss your smile, your warmth, your melodious voice. You really are the love of my life!</h5>

<h5>Itâ€™s hard to focus on my work because my mind is filled with your thoughts! Missing you so much!
</h5>
